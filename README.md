# Tower Defense

Notes: In tsconfig.json you might need to add "types": ["node"] to be able to use NodeJS.

# Game Initialization

You start with 100 coins and 5 lives.

# Things to take into Account

Every time you get to 200 coins you will get a life but lose the money, is like you are buying the lives, you can't decide if you want to purcharse it or not.

You can press Next Wave so the next wave will come earlier.

Every level the monsters are faster and have more lives.

If you put a tower where one already exists it will change the tower for the new one, take into account that even if you pout the same one you will lose money.

If a monster gets to the end of the path you will lose a life. If you lose all your lives you lose. But  a new game will start.

You can update a tower cliking in the yellow button below each tower. Each one has two updates, the first one to make the range bigger, and the second to shoot faster. Each update costs 150.
